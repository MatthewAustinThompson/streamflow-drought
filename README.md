# streamflow-drought

As climate change continues, the way people live is impacted more and more by the increase in frequency of extreme weather. One of the most tangible resources being affected is the supply of water. For years, we have used streamflow information to determine how much water is available in different locations, but these system changes are making it much more difficult to accurately predict these values. The goal of this project is to train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model on time-series streamflow data, and combine those outputs with the outputs of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on Landsat Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) data in order to predict future streamflow percentile values (0-14 days) for the Williams Fork Reservoir, CO area. We hope that our work will serve as a proof of concept that streamflow percentile predictions can continue to be accurate even with our changing climate as long as we incorporate satellite data within our models.
